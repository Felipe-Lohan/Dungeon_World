* ☐ **İmproved Weapon:** Choose one extra enhancement for your signature weapon.

* ☐ **Armored Perfection:** When you choose to **let your armor take the brunt of damage** dealt to you, the damage is negated; if you’re level 6 or higher, you also take +1 forward against the attacker.

Name NPCs, not player characters. The GM will make your vision come true, if it’s even remotely possible. On a 6- you see your own death and consequently take -1 ongoing throughout the battle.

* ☐ **Eye For Weaponry:** When you **look over an enemy’s weaponry**, ask the GM how much damage they do.

* ☐ **Superior Warrior:** When you **Hack & Slash**, on a 12+ you deal your damage, avoid their attack, and impress, dismay, or frighten your enemy.

* ☐ **Evil Eye:** When you **enter combat**, you can choose to activate this move. İn this case, roll+CHA – On a 10+, hold 2; on a 7-9, hold 1. Spend your hold to make eye contact with an NPC present, who freezes or flinches and can’t act until you break it off. On a 6-, your enemies immediately identify you as their biggest threat.
