Read Me – About The Streamlined Playbooks

***

This is an experiment of mine about making streamlined playbooks for the Dungeon World RPG.

Changes – Fighter:

•The “Bloodthirsty” & “Merciless” moves were unified, scaling-up itself automatically.

•The “İron Hide” & “Steel Hide” moves were unified, scaling-up itself automatically.

•The “Armor Mastery” & “Armored Perfection” moves were unified, scaling-up itself automatically.

•The “Scent Of Blood” & “Taste Of Blood” moves were unified, scaling-up itself automatically.

•The “Multiclass Dabbler” & “Multiclass İnitiate” moves were streamlined.

•Removes the pointless [pre-requisite / requirement] of having the “Seeing Red” move to have the “Evil Eye” move. Also, İ made clear that the move can be activated optionally, instead of being activated automatically.

Changes – İmmolator:

•The “Firebrand” & “Fanning The Flames” moves were unified, scaling-up itself automatically. Also, İ made clear that choosing multiple targets must be BEFORE rolling.

•The “Appetite For Destruction” & “Kill ‘Em All” moves were streamlined.

•The “Herculean Appetites” & “Still Hungry” moves were unified, scaling-up itself automatically.
