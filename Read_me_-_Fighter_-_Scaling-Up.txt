⚔️ Read Me – About The “Fighter (Scaling-Up Variant)” Playbook ⚔️

This is an experiment of mine about the Fighter playbook for the Dungeon World RPG.

Changes:

•The “Bloodthirsty” & “Merciless” moves were unified, scaling-up itself automatically.

•The “İron Hide” & “Steel Hide” moves were unified, scaling-up itself automatically.

•The “Armor Mastery” & “Armored Perfection” moves were unified, scaling-up itself automatically.

•The “Scent Of Blood” & “Taste Of Blood” moves were unified, scaling-up itself automatically.

•Removes the pointless [pre-requisite / requirement] of having the “Seeing Red” move to have the “Evil Eye” move. Also, İ made clear that the move can be activated optionally, instead of being activated automatically.
